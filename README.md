# Score Calculator

### How it works

Calculate a score based on three exams with customized weights for each one.
The first one, foundations, represents 30% of the total score, and the second, imperative, represents
50% of the total score, and objects represent 20% of the total score.

### Conditions to approve
1. Have all English lessons approved, with an average of 50%.
2. Have all CT lessons completed.
3. Have at least 50% of the score

Case 1: If you are between 50% and 50.99%, you will need evidence for each exam, and you will take a supervised exam.
Case 2: If you are 60% or above and missed some evidence, you will take a supervised exam.
Case 3: If you have 60% or above and completed all evidence, you passed.


NOTE: Evidence is only a question that needs to be answered.
